# Retail-sales-customer-satisfaction
This project analyses retail sales data, focusing on customer satisfaction, sales trends, and forecasting. The dataset contains sales and customer feedback information, including purchase amounts, product categories, return rates, and payment methods. The goal is to understand the dynamics of sales, identify factors that impact customer satisfaction, and forecast purchase amounts for future years. Excel was used for data cleaning, while Power BI was employed for analysis, visualization, and forecasting.

Tools Used

Excel (Data Cleaning) Data was first cleaned and prepared using Excel. The following tasks were performed: • Discount_Applied was converted to numeric format. • Inconsistent values in Return_Status were standardized to "Yes" or "No". • Missing or zero values in Customer_Age and Quantity were handled. • Mixed date formats in Purchase_Date were unified.

Power BI (Analysis & Visualizations) Data Analysis: • The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI for analysis. • New calculated columns such as Net_Sale (Purchase_Amount - Discount) and Age_Group (Youth, Adult, Senior) were created. Visualizations: Various charts and graphs were created to visualize key metrics: • Sales by Store_Type and Product_Category. • Customer satisfaction by Store_Location. • Return rates by Product_Category. • Payment Method vs Purchase Amount. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): • Average Customer Satisfaction. • Total Net Sales. • Return Rate %.

Forecasting: Purchase trends and future forecasts were created using Power BI’s forecasting features, which predict future purchase amounts based on historical data.

Forecasting Approach The forecasting for future purchase amounts was done using historical data. Power BI’s in-built forecasting feature was used to project future trends. The forecast is based on a time-series analysis, considering factors such as yearly purchase amounts, return rates, and product categories. The forecast is shown from 2023 to 2027, providing insights into expected sales trends and helping businesses plan accordingly.

Project Insights • The Net Sales by Store Type and Product Category show a significant variation, helping the business understand which store locations and product types perform better. • The Return Rates by product category can help identify products with high return rates, providing insights into customer dissatisfaction. • The Payment Method vs Purchase Amount visualization provides a clear understanding of the most popular payment methods and their relationship with total purchase amounts. • The Customer Satisfaction analysis by Store Location helps in pinpointing areas where customer service could be improved.

Conclusion This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of retail sales and customer satisfaction. By forecasting future sales and identifying key performance metrics, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction.
